# DC_Pyps
macOS implementation of David Colquhoun's Statistiscs Tools

All of the work porting from original FORTRAN was done by Remigijus Lape at UCL. 

This implementation takes advantage of the Mac defaulting to Qt instead of Tkinter.

Working out of the box on MacOS X 10.8 - 10.12 
Python version 2.7.10 (packaged with macOS)

Go to the terminal and type:

python dc_pyps.py

You can do a randomization test on continuous or binomial data, and look at Fiellers theorem too.
