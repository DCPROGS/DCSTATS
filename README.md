# DC Stats for Mac
macOS implementation of David Colquhoun's Statistiscs Tools

All of the work porting from original FORTRAN was done by Remigijus Lape at UCL. 

This implementation takes advantage of the nice Tkinter implementation in macOS.

Working out of the box on MacOS X 10.8 - 10.12 

Python version 2.7.10 (packaged with macOS)

Go to the terminal and type:

python DC_Stats.py

You can do a randomization test on continuous or binomial data, and look at Fiellers theorem too. 
Data from Excel should be saved in two columns as tab-delimited text.
